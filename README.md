<b> Intereactive dashboard created using plotly and panel <b\>

The notebook uses fake data and illustrates how an interactive investments dashboard can be created. A private saver can have savings and investments in multiple fund management companies and banks, so the idea is to create one dashboard of all data which is downloaded from them. Harmonizing the data into the same format and adding market values to it is a topic on its own. 

The app is launched in a new web page but panel apps a quite easy to deploy elsewhere too. 

The dashboard starts with some key performance indicators. The an asset allocation per type and by geography pie charts follow.

The geogrphical pie chart can be changed to use continent division.
